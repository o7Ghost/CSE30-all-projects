How to Compile
--------------
   To compile this program, simply navigate to pa3 folder by typing "cd pa4"
   In this folder contains all the source files, then type "make" to compile

How to Run
----------
  To run this program, first type "./myxd" then flags
  example of the flag are -x for HEX -o for OCTAL -s for STRING
  -c for ASCII. to convert a hex back to string the flag is -u

  so an example would be "./myxd" <flag> <filename>
  to convert hex to string ./myxd <flag> <file to write on> <file to read in>

Normal Output
-------------

  The normal output will be printed to stdout and if the user
  used -u flag option it will print to a file. 
  An example of normal output would be the following

  Print in hex

Abnormal Output
---------------

  There are several abnormal output and they are printed to stderr
  first is too many argument
  ./myxd infile extrafile
  Error: Incorrect number of positional arguments.
  ./myxd [-h] [-x | -o | -c | -s] [-l | -b] [-r range] [-u outfile] INFILE 

  There are too many flags
  ./myxd -x -c infile
  Error: Only one of -x, -c, -o, -s may be specified.
  ./myxd [-h] [-x | -o | -c | -s] [-l | -b] [-r range] [-u outfile] INFILE

  Range is not valid
  ./myxd -x -r 10 infile
  Error: Incorrect format for range.
  ./myxd [-h] [-x | -o | -c | -s] [-l | -b] [-r range] [-u outfile] INFILE

  The file doesn't exist 
  ./myxd nofile
  nofile: No such file or directory

  The end value of range is larger than the file size
  ./myxd -r 10:400 smallfile
  Error: Invalid range. Start and end must be > 0, end > start
  ./myxd [-h] [-x | -o | -c | -s] [-l | -b] [-r range] [-u outfile] INFILE

How I Tested
------------
  i first wrote tester files to test if my output is correct then i use
  the public tester to compare output using my eyes. i then put
  the output into a file and use diff to see if the output matches

Question
--------

  1.
  Use ctrl-a to increase it under the cursor or to the right. 
  2.
