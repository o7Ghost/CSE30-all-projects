 How i Tested
 ------------

 i first tested file errors by entering invalid file name and extra file name
 then i test the commands when it is in the file by entering invalid commands
 to see if the invalid cases would pop up. i then tested it with correct
 output and compare it using diff. i then test it with raw commands and
 arguments to see if the output is correct. i see if the output match with
 visual debugged and then compare it using diff
